# WebGL Fluid Simulation

This is a small side project to simulate fluid effects on an html document using `vanilla JS`, `HTML` and `CSS`.

I got the idea from [Dagshub Homepage](https://dagshub.com/) initially and then went over to look for some tutorials and I found [this one](https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation) to be short and simple.
